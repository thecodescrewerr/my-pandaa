# Day 2 – Feature Engineering + Regression

This notebook focuses on preparing the cleaned mental health dataset for regression modeling.

## ✔️ Tasks Performed
- One-hot encoding of categorical columns
- MinMax scaling of numeric features
- Combined all features into a fully numeric dataset

## 💾 Output
- `df_encoded`: Encoded dataset
- `df_scaled`: Scaled and ready for regression

## 📌 Next Steps
- Feature selection
- Train Linear, Lasso & Ridge models
- Evaluate using MSE, MAE, and R²
