Handle Missing Values

Fills missing values in numerical columns using mean with SimpleImputer.

Fills categorical columns using the mode (most frequent value).

Remove Outliers
Filters out records with WorkHoursPerWeek > 80 as unrealistic.

EDA Visualizations

A scatter plot shows the relationship between Stress Level and Sleep Hours.

A box plot compares Work Hours per Week across Burnout Levels.

Final Check
